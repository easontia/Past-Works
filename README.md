UNDERGRAD

(MATLAB)

AM  170A is a course that focuses on problems that can be solved using only analytical tools, and simple Matlab routines. This final project I studied Optimizing Porosity for permeability by constructe a model of water trickling through the material and simulate it. 

AM  170B is a advanced course similiar to 170A, for the final project, I analyzed the time series data of cause of death around the world, using PCA, lasso and clustering to forcast the cause of the death around the world. The file also include homeworks throughout the semester.

(FORTRAN)

AM 127 used mainly fortran, C and python, in this course's final project I used FORTRAN to study the behavior of particles moving through 3-dimension space and record their trajectors. I also include homeworks that was done in other languages.

MASTER

(Python/MATLAB)

MATH 512 is a course that used python to solve a lot financial problems like binomial tree, option pricing and probability theroy proof. this folder include some homeworks that was done using programming tools.

MATH 599 is a course that introduce different machine learning techniques. In my group final project, me and my group members studied the cryptocurrency market investment strategies based on deep reinforcement learning(DRL). This was mainly done in python.

ECON 515 is a course on time series analysis, this is a course I am currently taking. For the final project, Me and my group are planning to do a vacancy housing time series data analysis, we are planning to use diff and diff and then use pca to analysis it and forecast the future vacancy of the housing.
